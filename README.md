This project was originally created between December 2024 – January 2025 as an improved init script for my old executor Stellar. I decided to upload it to GitHub and load the script from there instead of storing it as a file.

The environment has around 95% UNC support (last tested several months ago, so this may no longer be correct) and t's compatible with most scripts.

It should support Vape V4, but this hasn’t been recently tested.

Enjoy!
