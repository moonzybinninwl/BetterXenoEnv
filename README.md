This was made back in December 2024 - January 2025 as a better init script for my old executor 'Stellar'. I decided to put it on github and fetch the script from github instead of having it as a file.
This env has 95% UNC (this was tested months ago, this may be wrong) and it supports most scripts.

I think it supprots vapev4?
Enjoy.
